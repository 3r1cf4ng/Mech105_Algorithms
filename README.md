# Mech105_Algorithms
The following files in this repository reflect the algorithms I developed over the course of Mech 105. Algorithms are handmade MATLAB functions that execute a specific method in the interest of integration, rootfinding, etc.
The files consist of:
* Matrices
* False Position (root finding method)
* LU Decomposition 
* Simpson's 1/3 rule (integration method)
* Linear Regression
