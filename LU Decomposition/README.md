# LU Decomposition (LU Factorization)
This function solves,with partial pivoting, a portion of systems of equations in matrix format. The U provides the new system of equations after decomposition, the L provides the factoring agents that allow the U to decompose in a form of elimination.
### Inputs
* A - the coefficient matrix 
### Outputs
* L - lower triangular matrix of factors
* U - upper triangular matrix of decomposed coefficient matrix
* P - the permutation matrix that tracks the pivoting nature
