# Simpson's 1/3 Rule
This function is a numerical integration approximation that only applies to equally spaced independent variable values. It takes two vectors and integrates them using the simpson's 1/3 composite rule, the trapezoidal rule, or a combination of both in dependence on the sizes of the vectors. This is heavily reliant on formulas, but makes them much easier to do than by hand.
### Inputs
* x - the vector of the independent variables
* y - the vector of function values dependent on x
### Outputs
* I - the value of the numerical integral approximated
